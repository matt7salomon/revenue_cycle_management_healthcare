    "This notebook provides a foundation for an advanced hospital CRM system using Neo4j. It demonstrates how to model complex relationships inherent in hospital data and how to interact with the database using Python. You can extend this system by adding more features, optimizing queries, and integrating with other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhancements to Consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement role-based access control.\n",
    "- **API Layer**: Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create RESTful APIs.\n",
    "- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Optimize appointment scheduling based on doctor availability.\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Use Neo4j's graph algorithms library for advanced analytics.\n",
    "- **Notification System**: Integrate with email/SMS services for reminders and notifications.\n",
    "- **Front-end Interface**: Build an interactive UI using frameworks like React or Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Ensure that you handle sensitive data securely, complying with regulations like HIPAA if this system is used in a real-world healthcare setting."
